#  FAQ
##What is the detaildata portal?
The portal is a data catalogue: a list of various datasets relevant to Northern Ireland. 
The portal focuses on the needs of the local voluntary and community sector, but in no way limits the datasets that can be hosted here.
Users can access, view and download data from the datasets available here. They can also create datasets.
##What is open data?
Open data is data that is available to be accessed, modified and shared without restriction (excepting, in some cases, attribution of authors). 
Readily-available and relateable licences are available from [Open Knowledge](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/) (and via this portal), in line with the open definition.
Through open data transparency is increased, social and economic value unleashed and civic participation and engagement unlocked.
You can read more about open data and openness [here](http://opendefinition.org/).
##Why was the detaildata portal created?
The portal was created to serve as a central data responsitory for Northern Ireland and to address a lack of such a comprehensive platform.
It is designed in such a way to make it easy for anyone to use and contribute to. The portal is also intended to increase supply and demand, as well as awareness, of open data.
As part of the detaildata project, supported by the BIG Lottery Fund, the portal also serves to contribute to the work of voluntary and community organisations in the effective use of data.
##What is the platform behind the portal?
The portal was created on an open source cataloguing tool called DKAN. 
DKAN has been created specifically for storing, publishing and accessing data online, and is modelled on the CKAN platform (used, for example, by [data.gov.uk](http://www.data.gov.uk)).
Integrated with the Drupal content management system, DKAN has a number of useful features such as the ability to preview and visualise data, link datasets to those in other data catalogues, and exposing metadata to the Web.
We are also able to respond to the need to add or adjust features in future.
