We focus on the needs of the local voluntary and community sector, but this focus in no way limits the range of datasets that can be hosted.\r\n\r\nUsers can access, view and download data from the datasets available on the Portal. They can also create datasets.\r\n\r\nOpen Data is data that is available to be accessed, modified and shared without restriction (though in some cases, requirements to attribute authors may be included). Through openness transparency is increased, social and economic value unleashed and civic participation and engagement unlocked.\r\n\r\n#DetailData Project#\r\nAs part of the wider DetailData project the Portal serves voluntary and community organisations in the effective use of data in their work.  \r\n\r\nOur goals are to stimulate innovation, promote research, engage public participation in government, increase transparency, inform decision-making and to help organisations tap in to the potential of data as a powerful resource for social change.\r\n\r\n##Partners##\r\nThe Portal forms part of the DetailData project in partnership:  \r\n\r\n![alt text](http://www.nicva.org/sites/all/themes/theme/images/nicva_logo.png)  \r\n---------------------------------\r\n[NICVA](http://www.nicva.org/about-us) support and represent voluntary and community organisations across Northern Ireland.
