<p>The DetailData Portal is a publicly-accessible data catalogue providing access to datasets relevant to Northern Ireland, including databases, pre-formatted tables, statistical reports, APIs and other resources.</p>

<p>The Portal is dedicated to promoting access to public, private and voluntary and community sector data. We focus on the needs of the local voluntary and community sector, but this focus in no way limits the range of datasets that can be hosted.</p>

<p>Users can access, view and download data from the datasets available on the Portal. They can also create datasets.</p>

<p>Open Data is data that is available to be accessed, modified and shared without restriction (though in some cases, requirements to attribute authors may be included). Through openness transparency is increased, social and economic value unleashed and civic participation and engagement unlocked.</p>

The DetailData Portal is built on DKAN, the Drupal-based version of CKAN, the world's leading open source open data publishing platform. It provides a complete open source software solution for data publishers, and adheres to the API, data, and functionality standards of CKAN. The goal of the project is to combine the utility of CKAN with the ease of maintenance and extensibility of Drupal.</p>
